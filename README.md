This is a boilerplate of the structure that I'm currently using in my projects when choosing the 7-1 pattern, this will be uploaded over time.

> **Disclaimer:** I'm starting to learn how to use **Git/Github** correctly, therefore there'll be plenty of pull requests, commits and other stuff as tests in this repository, however, *this won't represent my way of working forever*, I'll learn more things along the way as always :D!.

> **Note:** this is a temporary boilerplate due to I'm currently learning about [Yeoman](https://yeoman.io/) and when I consider myself good enough at it, I'll start using my own templates from there.

## What's Yeoman?
Yeoman is an open source client-side scaffolding tool for web applications. Yeoman runs as a command-line interface written for Node.js and combines several functions into one place, such as generating a starter template, managing dependencies, running unit tests, providing a local development server, and optimizing production code for deployment.
